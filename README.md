# LatticeBoltzmannD3Q19

These set of codes include MATLAB implementation of Lattice Boltzmann models D3Q19 (3D) and D2Q9 (2D) models.

Inputs should be black and white (binary) images of pore spaces. Binary image should be such that they are all 0s and 1s. 0 represents black (solids), 1 represent pores where the waters go through.

The entry code is 'D3Q19_D2Q9_GUI.m'.
